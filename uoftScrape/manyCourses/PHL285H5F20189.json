{"id": "PHL285H5F20189", "code": "PHL285H5F", "name": "Philosophy of Art", "description": "A study of some of the most important philosophical questions about art. For example, what exactly is a work of art? Can any object whatsoever be, or become, an artwork? Who or what determines whether something is art? Does each person decide for themselves, or does a certain community (the \"art world\") decide? Can one interpretation or evaluation of a work be better, or more justified, than another? If so, how do we tell which one is better?
