This course focuses on form and function of visual, auditory, tactile, and chemical senses. Post-acquisition, cognitive processes concerned with learning, memory, and decision-making will also be discussed. A comparative approach will be taken to examine how different animals rely on different sources of information as well as a diverse array of sensory and cognitive mechanisms. Fields considered will include sensory physiology, ecology, comparative cognition, and neuroethology, and all topics will be covered in the context of ecology and evolution\".
