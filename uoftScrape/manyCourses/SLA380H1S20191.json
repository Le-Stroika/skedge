While focus will be on states that arose from the Former Soviet Union and the languages of Central and Southeastern Europe, discussion will open to cover a broad range of language issues, including, for example orthography shifts here in Canada and around the world, including China, Korea, Japan, and India. We will explore issues such as language standards, language rights, language conflict, languages of education, writing systems and linguistic identity.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Slavic Languages and Literatures", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [3], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["C Kramer"], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 50400, "duration": 7200, "location": "VC 323"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 0}]}
