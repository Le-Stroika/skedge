{"id": "CME261H1F20189", "code": "CME261H1F", "name": "Engineering Mathematics I", "description": "This course deals with both numerical methods for engineering analysis (solution of linear and non-linear equations, interpolation, numerical integration) and advanced topics in analytical calculus (multiple integrals and vector analysis). Within the numerical methods portion of the course emphasis is placed on problem formulation, solution algorithm design and programming applications. Within the analytical calculus portion emphasis is placed on the mathematical foundations of engineering practice and the interrelationship between analytical and numerical solution methods.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Civil and Mineral Engineering", "prerequisites": "MAT188H1, MAT187H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 200, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2018 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "T0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 61200, "end": 64800, "duration": 3600, "location": "HA 403"}], "size": 75, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["M Hatzopoulou"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1130"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1130"}, {"day": "MONDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "SF 1105"}], "size": 150, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 61200, "end": 64800, "duration": 3600, "location": "GB 150"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 61200, "end": 64800, "duration": 3600, "location": "GB 144"}], "size": 75, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "WB 255"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "GB 150"}], "size": 75, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 46800, "duration": 3600, "location": "MY 360"}], "size": 75, "enrolment": 0}]}
