{"id": "VIC166H1S20191", "code": "VIC166H1S", "name": "Common Vices and Neglected Virtues: Intro to Ethics of Character", "description": "Vice is popular: a prestigious university press has brought out a series of seven books on the Seven Deadly Sins. This course examines such questions as the following. Are greed, lust and gluttony just bad names for necessary and otherwise acceptable instincts? What is the place, in a good human life, of such qualities as honesty, trust, civility and the like? Are vices and virtues culturally determined or a matter of individual preference? Can character be taught, or is it rather a matter of genes and luck? Not eligible for CR/NCR option.  In this course an additional fee of up to $50 may be charged for activities outside of the classroom (e.g., field trips). Such fees will be confirmed in the course syllabus.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Victoria College", "prerequisites": "Admission to Vic One", "exclusions": "Innis One, Munk One, New One, SMC One, Trinity One, UC One, Woodsworth One, 199 seminars, Vic One Hundred courses.", "level": 100, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [2], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["P Gooch"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 57600, "duration": 7200, "location": "BC 20"}], "size": 25, "enrolment": 0}]}
