How does the abstract world of the law get translated into predictable, concrete decisions? How do judges decide what is the \u201ccorrect\u201d decision in a given case? The class will begin with an overview of the legal system before delving into the ideas guiding statute drafting and interpretation, judicial review and administrative discretion, the meaning of \u201cevidence\u201d and \u201cproof,\u201d constitutionalism, and appellate review.
