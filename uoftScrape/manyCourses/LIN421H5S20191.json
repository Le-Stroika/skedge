However, in the real world, particularly in linguistically diverse communities such as the GTA, there is an enormous amount of variability driven by differences in language background, regional affiliation, and social factors. This course examines the many factors contributing to accentedness, and how listeners adapt their perception when confronted with different accents. It also explores how models of language development, processing, and production account for accent-related variability.", "division": "University of Toronto Mississauga", "department": "Language Studies", "prerequisites": "LIN229H5, LIN256H5/LIN288H5, and 0.5 credit in a 300-level LIN course.", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTM", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "P0101", "instructors": ["J Schertz"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "CC 2140"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 0}]}
