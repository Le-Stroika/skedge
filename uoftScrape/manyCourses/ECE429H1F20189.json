{"id": "ECE429H1F20189", "code": "ECE429H1F", "name": "Machine Intelligence Capstone Design", "description": "A half-year capstone design course in which students work in small teams to apply the engineering design, technical, and communication skills learned previously, while refining their skills in teamwork and project management. The course will take a \u201csystems approach\u201d to machine intelligence design, where students will identify, frame and design solutions to real-world problems in the field. Students will engage with industry partners, and work through a process that results in a functional prototype. The resulting designs are assessed on their engineering quality and design credibility. In addition, each student engages in individual critical reflection on their course activities, team performance, and on their growth as an engineering designer across their undergraduate program. Students are supported by a teaching team comprising both design and domain experts.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Division of Engineering Science", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2018 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": [], "times": [], "size": 0, "enrolment": 0}]}
