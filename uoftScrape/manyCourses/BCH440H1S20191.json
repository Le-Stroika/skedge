{"id": "BCH440H1S20191", "code": "BCH440H1S", "name": "Protein Biosynthesis", "description": "\"The life of proteins: from birth to death\". This course is presented as eight themes. 1. Structure, assembly, and evolution of the ribosome. 2. mRNA synthesis, maturation, and localization. 3. Mechanisms and regulation of translation initiation. 4. Fidelity during translation elongation. 5. Translation termination and translation-mediated mRNA decay. 6. Nascent protein folding and molecular chaperones. 7. Protein aging, misfolding and disease. 8. Protein degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome system and autophagy. In addition to the lectures, students will work in groups during tutorial sessions to interpret a recent paper related to one of the eight themes to be formally presented during regular class hours.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Biochemistry", "prerequisites": "BCH210H1/BCH242Y1; BCH311H1/MGY311Y1/PSL350H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [4], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["J Glover"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 36000, "duration": 3600, "location": "MS 4279"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 36000, "duration": 3600, "location": "MS 4279"}], "size": 45, "enrolment": 0}]}
