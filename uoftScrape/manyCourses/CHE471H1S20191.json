Topics will include a review of physical laws, selection of balance space, compartmental versus distributed models, and applications of the conservation laws for both discrete and continuous systems at the level of algebraic and ordinary differential equations. The course covers a wide range of applications including environmental issues, chemical and biochemical processes and biomedical systems.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["R Farnood"], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "MY 030"}, {"day": "MONDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 36000, "duration": 3600, "location": "MY 030"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 39600, "duration": 3600, "location": "MY 030"}], "size": 43, "enrolment": 0}]}
