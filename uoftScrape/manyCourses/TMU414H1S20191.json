It is intended to bridge the gap between the fundamentals of instrumentation and advanced orchestration. The course will begin with basic score reading, including transposition. Repertoire for analysis will be drawn from orchestral, wind ensemble, and choral/vocal/orchestral music from the Classical era to the present day. Scores will be analyzed for instrumental combinations, as well as for idiomatic writing for instruments and instrumental groups. Notation and performance problems will be examined", "division": "Faculty of Music", "department": "Faculty of Music", "prerequisites": "TMU314Y1 or P.I.", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["G Kulesha"], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 54000, "duration": 7200, "location": "EJ 216"}], "size": 25, "enrolment": 0}]}
