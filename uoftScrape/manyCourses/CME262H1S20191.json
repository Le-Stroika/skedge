{"id": "CME262H1S20191", "code": "CME262H1S", "name": "Engineering Mathematics II", "description": "This course continues the study of numerical and analytical methods for civil engineering analysis. Analytical and numerical methods for solving ordinary differential equations are treated in some detail, followed by numerical solution methods for partial differential equations. The final major topic of the course deals with an introduction to optimization. Emphasis is placed throughout the course on problem formulation, solution algorithm design and programming applications.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Civil and Mineral Engineering", "prerequisites": "CME261H1", "exclusions": "CME362H1", "level": 200, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["X Huang"], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 64800, "duration": 7200, "location": "MB 128"}, {"day": "MONDAY", "start": 61200, "end": 64800, "duration": 3600, "location": "MB 128"}], "size": 150, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 1210"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "HA 401"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0103", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "MY 315"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 0}]}
