{"id": "ESS223H1F20189", "code": "ESS223H1F", "name": "Earth System Chemistry 1: Earth Materials", "description": "This course introduces the basic principles of thermodynamics and kinetics and more specialized concepts used in the Earth Sciences, e.g., the forms and transfer of energy, the equation of states of gaseous, fluid and solid materials, thermodynamics of solutions, chemical equilibria of multicomponent systems, mineral solubility, phase diagrams, phase interface processes on mineral surfaces, and mass transport. The tutorials will include basic calculation exercises and some computational modeling used to understand fluid phase reactions and phase equilibria in the earth system. The course aims to provide a solid background for advanced courses in igneous and metamorphic petrology, aqueous geochemistry and geodynamics.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Earth Sciences", "prerequisites": "MAT135H1, MAT136H1, CHM135H1, ESS221H1, ESS262H1", "exclusions": "ENV233H1", "level": 200, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2018 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["G Henderson"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 57600, "duration": 7200, "location": "ES 1067"}], "size": 55, "enrolment": 0}]}
