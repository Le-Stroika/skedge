{"id": "EEB362H1F20189", "code": "EEB362H1F", "name": "Macroevolution", "description": "Explores patterns and processes of large-scale evolutionary change, played out over large geographic expanses and extended periods of time. Integrates information from paleontology, phylogenetics, field studies, functional biology, and experiments to link emergent evolutionary patterns to underlying evolutionary processes. Topics include: speciation, phylogenetic inference, adaptive vs. non-adaptive evolution, evolutionary constraints, diversification and extinction, evolutionary innovations, historical biogeography, and the relationship between evolutionary history and ecology. Tutorials will illustrate common analytical approaches to macroevolutionary investigation and provide in-depth exploration of landmark studies in macroevolution.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Ecology and Evolutionary Biology", "prerequisites": "BIO220H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2018 Fall", "breadths": [4], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 36000, "duration": 3600, "location": "RW 117"}], "size": 108, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["D Mahler"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "RW 117"}], "size": 108, "enrolment": 0}]}
