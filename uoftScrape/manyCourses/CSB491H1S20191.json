{"id": "CSB491H1S20191", "code": "CSB491H1S", "name": "Team-Based Research: Research in Cell and Molecular Biology", "description": "CSB491H1 will build on molecular biology and biochemistry approaches acquired in CSB350H1 to investigate the role of metabolic enzymes in plants. Students participating in this course will develop laboratory and team-work skills that are desirable for them to function in a research laboratory and in the workplace. The course will integrate current molecular biology techniques, including designing and characterizing mutants made with CRISPR/Cas9, identifying protein interactors, and performing structural and mechanistic analysis of metabolic enzymes.
