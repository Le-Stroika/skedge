{"id": "CHE322H1S20191", "code": "CHE322H1S", "name": "Process Control", "description": "The major goal of this course is to teach students how to design control strategies for chemical processes. The first part of the course focuses on the types of interconnections encountered in chemical engineering, namely feedback, parallel and series connections, and their effect on the process dynamics. The second part of the course looks at the design of feedback, feedforward, cascade and multivariable control strategies for these processes and interprets these types of engineered interconnections in terms of the effect they have on the performance of the overall system. This course makes extensive use of active learning through computer simulation based on MATLAB/Simulink and Aspen Plus Dynamics software.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["W Cluett"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 36000, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1190"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 36000, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1190"}, {"day": "MONDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1190"}], "size": 120, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 50400, "duration": 7200, "location": "MY 030"}], "size": 60, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 50400, "duration": 7200, "location": "MY 030"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 0}]}
