Topics include energy demands throughout the economy, major energy technologies, how these technologies work, how they are evaluated quantitatively, their economics and their impacts on the environment. In addition, the ever changing context in which these technologies (and emerging technologies) are being implemented will be outlined. Systems approaches including life cycle assessment, will be refined and applied to evaluate energy systems. A particular focus will be placed on analysis of energy alternatives within a carbon constrained economy.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Civil and Mineral Engineering", "prerequisites": "CIV375H1, CIV220H1, CME368H1.", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["A Milovanoff S Alavy Ghahfarrokhy"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 39600, "duration": 3600, "location": "LM 162"}, {"day": "MONDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 50400, "duration": 7200, "location": "SF 1101"}], "size": 120, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 36000, "duration": 3600, "location": "SF 3201"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 36000, "duration": 3600, "location": "SF 3202"}], "size": 120, "enrolment": 0}]}
