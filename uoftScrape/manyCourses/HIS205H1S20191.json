{"id": "HIS205H1S20191", "code": "HIS205H1S", "name": "Topics in Women's History", "description": "This course introduces students to the diverse experiences of women from a comparative perspective. Students will study how women\u2019s strategies have shaped the major cultural, economic, political and social processes in the world and how these processes have affected women\u2019s experiences in their particular societies. By studying women\u2019s history from both local and global perspectives, students will engage critically with claims that women\u2019s history is universal. The local focus of the course will rotate between Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America, depending on the expertise of the instructors.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "History", "prerequisites": "None", "exclusions": "HIS245Y1", "level": 200, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [3], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "T0501", "instructors": ["J Rombough"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "BL 113"}], "size": 19, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0601", "instructors": ["J Rombough"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 57600, "duration": 3600, "location": "BL 113"}], "size": 19, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0301", "instructors": ["A Logue"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 46800, "duration": 3600, "location": "UC F204"}], "size": 18, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T5101", "instructors": ["J Rombough"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 68400, "end": 72000, "duration": 3600, "location": "WE 69"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0401", "instructors": ["J Rombough"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "UC F204"}], "size": 18, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T5201", "instructors": ["J Rombough"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 72000, "end": 75600, "duration": 3600, "location": "WE 69"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "L5101", "instructors": ["A Graham"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 61200, "end": 68400, "duration": 7200, "location": "SS 2118"}], "size": 150, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": ["A Logue"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 39600, "duration": 3600, "location": "BL 312"}], "size": 18, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0201", "instructors": ["A Logue"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "BL 312"}], "size": 18, "enrolment": 0}]}
