Topics include: sample space, events, definitions of probability, conditional probability, Bayes' theorem, important classes of discrete and continuous random variables and their distributions, joint, conditional, and marginal distributions, expectation, moment generating and characteristic functions, transformations of random variables, central limit theorem and approximations. Graphical methods, quantile plots, point and interval estimation of population parameters, method of maximum likelihood. Hypothesis testing, simple and multiple regression, correlation analysis, and introduction to Bayesian statistics.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Division of Engineering Science", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "CHE223H1, CME263H1, MSE238H1, MIE236H1, MIE237H1, MIE231H1, STA286H1 or STA257H1", "level": 200, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["D Kundur"], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 46800, "duration": 7200, "location": "SS 2102"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "SS 2102"}], "size": 220, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 2159"}], "size": 28, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "SS 2111"}], "size": 28, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0103", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1200"}], "size": 28, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0104", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "SS 2105"}], "size": 28, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0105", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "MY 320"}], "size": 28, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0106", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "MY 430"}], "size": 28, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0107", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "HA 410"}], "size": 28, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0108", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "MY 420"}], "size": 28, "enrolment": 0}]}
