{"id": "CIV332H1S20191", "code": "CIV332H1S", "name": "Transport II - Performance", "description": "This course focuses on the fundamental techniques of transportation systems performance analysis with emphasis on congested traffic networks. Topics include transportation demand, supply and equilibrium, traffic assignment, network equilibrium, and system optimality, traffic flow theory, shockwaves, highway capacity analysis, introduction to deterministic and stochastic queuing analyses, intersection signal control types and related timing methods, and traffic simulation. The course also provides an introduction to basic elements of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Civil and Mineral Engineering", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["I Taha T Muhammad"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 50400, "duration": 7200, "location": "MC 252"}, {"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1190"}], "size": 114, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "MY 380"}, {"day": "MONDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "ES B142"}], "size": 113, "enrolment": 0}]}
