{"id": "SOC450H5S20191", "code": "SOC450H5S", "name": "Walls to Bridges: Carceral Seminar", "description": "Based on the Walls to Bridges Program model, this seminar course matches a group of University of Toronto students (\"outside\" students) with an approximately equal number of incarcerated students (\"inside\" students) who study together as peers at an off-campus setting. Topics will vary by instructor, but will often revolve around questions of punishment, prisons and governance. Most class sessions will be held inside the institution (e.g., penitentiary, detention centre, halfway house, etc.). Inside and outside students will work together on small teams to develop and then present a final project. Interested students should submit an application to the Department of Sociology (see website for details). Preference given to eligible Criminology, Law and Society Specialists and Majors.[24S]", "division": "University of Toronto Mississauga", "department": "Sociology", "prerequisites": "SOC205H5/SOC231H5, SOC209H5, SOC221H5, SOC222H5, completed at least 13.0 credits, P.I.", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTM", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["P Goodman"], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 82800, "duration": 25200, "location": ""}], "size": 15, "enrolment": 0}]}
