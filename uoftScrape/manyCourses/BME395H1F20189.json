{"id": "BME395H1F20189", "code": "BME395H1F", "name": "Biomedical Systems Engineering II: Cells and Tissues", "description": "This course focuses on the molecular biology of cells, building on BME205, and their integration into tissues and organs. It covers integrating cells into tissues; molecular genetic techniques; signalling at the cell surface and signalling pathways that control gene activity; integration of signals and gene controls, the eukaryotic cell cycle, cell birth, lineage and death; inflammation, wound healing and immunology. The course will be centered around the problems of tissue engineering and of other medical devices or therapeutic options. There will be considerable emphasis on learning to read the research literature.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Division of Engineering Science", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "CHE353H1", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2018 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["M Sefton"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "GB 117"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 57600, "duration": 10800, "location": "MB 325"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "MY 490"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 0}]}
