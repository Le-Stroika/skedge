{"id": "CIV214H1S20191", "code": "CIV214H1S", "name": "Structural Analysis I", "description": "This course provides an introduction to the nature of loads and restraints and types of structural elements, and then reviews the analysis of statically determinate structures. Shear and moment diagrams for beams and frames are considered, along with influence lines, cantilever structures, three-pin arches, cables and fatigue. Virtual work principles are viewed and applied to various structural systems. An introduction to the analysis of indeterminate structures is made, and the Portal method is applied to the analysis of building frames under lateral loads.\u00a0 Displacement methods of an analysis including moment distribution are also studied.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Civil and Mineral Engineering", "prerequisites": "MAT188H1, CME210H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 200, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["E Bentz"], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "SS 2118"}, {"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1180"}], "size": 120, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "SS 2118"}], "size": 60, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "SF 3201"}], "size": 60, "enrolment": 0}]}
