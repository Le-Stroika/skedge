{"id": "BCH444H1S20191", "code": "BCH444H1S", "name": "Protein Trafficking in the Secretory & Endocytic Pathways", "description": "This course examines the molecular details of the secretory and endocytic pathways in the cell. Some of the specific topics covered will include protein translocation into the ER, chaperones and protein folding in the ER, retrotranslocation and protein degradation, the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), vesicle biogenesis and ER-Golgi transport, regulated secretion, basic concepts in endocytosis and protein sorting in polarized cells. Emphasis is placed on current experimental approaches. A good understanding of basic biochemical methods is an asset. Participants must have a minimum cGPA of 2.8.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Biochemistry", "prerequisites": "BCH210H1/BCH242Y1; BCH311H1/MGY311Y1/PSL350H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [4], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["W Trimble I Stagljar J Rini"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 39600, "duration": 3600, "location": "NL 6"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 39600, "duration": 3600, "location": "NL 6"}], "size": 60, "enrolment": 0}]}
