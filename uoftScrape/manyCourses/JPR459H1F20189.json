{"id": "JPR459H1F20189", "code": "JPR459H1F", "name": "Fanaticism: A Political History", "description": "This seminar in theory will explore the modern history of the concept of \u2018fanaticism\u2019 and its role in the development of political modernity. A focus on the concept of the \u201cfanatic\u201d (and its cognates) from the perspective of its various uses in political and religious thought from the Early Modern period through the Enlightenment and up to the present day, provides a fascinating opportunity for a critical review of the secular, rationalist, and scientific assumptions underwriting modern political forms and concepts, especially those of liberal democracy. At the same time, the course will offer critical insight into the ways in which religious and political differences among colonial \u201cothers\u201d were, and continue to be, central to the elaboration of Western theoretical discourse on fanaticism and extremism as forms of \u201cpolitical pathology\u201d.
