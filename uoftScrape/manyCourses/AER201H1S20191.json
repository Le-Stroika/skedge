{"id": "AER201H1S20191", "code": "AER201H1S", "name": "Engineering Design", "description": "Design of integrated, multidisciplinary systems is introduced through a major course project. Project selection and definition of functions and performance objectives for the open-ended design problem will take place early on by teams of students, while learning practical subjects of engineering in lectures and workshops. This process will lead to the preparation of project proposals consisting of identification of design objectives and constraints, generation and evaluation of potential approaches, selection of the most promising design concept, identification of product subsystems, and assignment of responsibilities to team members. Following project approval, the design process will comprise preliminary design, followed by detailed design, prototype construction and testing, and preparation of a final design report. Progress is evaluated weekly, culminating in a prototype demonstration and design review.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Division of Engineering Science", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 200, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["M Emami"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "PB B150"}], "size": 220, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 64800, "duration": 18000, "location": "SF 4102"}, {"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 64800, "duration": 18000, "location": "SF 4003"}, {"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 64800, "duration": 14400, "location": "SF 4103"}, {"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 64800, "duration": 14400, "location": "SF 4102"}, {"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 64800, "duration": 14400, "location": "SF 4003"}, {"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 64800, "duration": 18000, "location": "SF 4103"}], "size": 72, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0103", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 64800, "duration": 18000, "location": "SF 4102"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 64800, "duration": 18000, "location": "SF 4003"}, {"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 64800, "duration": 14400, "location": "SF 4103"}, {"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 64800, "duration": 14400, "location": "SF 4102"}, {"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 64800, "duration": 14400, "location": "SF 4003"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 64800, "duration": 18000, "location": "SF 4103"}], "size": 72, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 64800, "duration": 18000, "location": "SF 4103"}, {"day": "MONDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 64800, "duration": 18000, "location": "SF 4102"}, {"day": "MONDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 64800, "duration": 18000, "location": "SF 4003"}, {"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 64800, "duration": 14400, "location": "SF 4103"}, {"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 64800, "duration": 14400, "location": "SF 4102"}, {"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 64800, "duration": 14400, "location": "SF 4003"}], "size": 72, "enrolment": 0}]}
