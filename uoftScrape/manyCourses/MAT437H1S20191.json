{"id": "MAT437H1S20191", "code": "MAT437H1S", "name": "K-Theory and C* Algebras", "description": "The course will begin with a description of the method (K-theoretical in spirit) used by Murray and von Neumann to give a rough initial classification of von Neumann algebras (into types I, II, and III). It will centre around the relatively recent use of K-theory to study Bratteli's approximately finite-dimensional C*-algebras---both to classify them (a result that can be formulated and proved purely algebraically), and to prove that the class of these C*-algebras---what Bratteli called AF algebras---is closed under passing to extensions (a result that uses the Bott periodicity feature of K-theory). Students will be encouraged to prepare oral or written reports on various subjects related to the course, including basic theory and applications.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Mathematics", "prerequisites": "MAT436H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [5], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["G Elliott"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "HU 1018"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "HU 1018"}, {"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "HU 1018"}], "size": 15, "enrolment": 0}]}
