{"id": "ECE568H1S20191", "code": "ECE568H1S", "name": "Computer Security", "description": "As computers permeate our society, the security of such computing systems is becoming of paramount importance. This course covers principles of computer systems security. To build secure systems, one must understand how attackers operate. This course starts by teaching students how to identify security vulnerabilities and how they can be exploited. Then techniques to create secure systems and defend against such attacks will be discussed. Industry standards for conducting security audits to establish levels of security will be introduced. The course will include an introduction to basic cryptographic techniques as well as hardware used to accelerate cryptographic operations in ATM\u2019s and webservers.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Edward S.
