{"id": "MIE324H1F20189", "code": "MIE324H1F", "name": "Introduction to Machine Intelligence", "description": "This course will provide students with an overview of the major, introduce them to some basic techniques, and illustrate those techniques through case studies. Techniques will include the basics of machine learning, e.g., linear regression, logistic regression, support-vector machines, neural networks, and the use of these techniques to improve decision making through improved predictions or directly in optimization models. A significant component of the course will be hands-on exposure to a stateof-the-art machine-learning software framework with a series of assignments, culminating in a design project where the students work in a team to build a larger-scale machine learning application, and communicate and demonstrate their accomplishments.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Division of Engineering Science", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2018 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["J Rose"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1240"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1240"}, {"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1240"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "MY 380"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 0}]}
