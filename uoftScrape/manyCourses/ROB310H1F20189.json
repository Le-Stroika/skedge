{"id": "ROB310H1F20189", "code": "ROB310H1F", "name": "Mathematics for Robotics", "description": "The course addresses advanced mathematical concepts particularly relevant for robotics. The mathematical tools covered in this course are fundamental for understanding, analyzing, and designing robotics algorithms that solve tasks such as robot path planning, robot vision, robot control and robot learning. Topics include complex analysis, optimization techniques, signals and filtering, advanced probability theory, and numerical methods. Concepts will be studied in a mathematically rigorous way but will be motivated with robotics examples throughout the course.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Division of Engineering Science", "prerequisites": "MAT185H1, MAT292H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2018 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["A Schoellig"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 1200"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 39600, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1210"}], "size": 60, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1210"}], "size": 60, "enrolment": 0}]}
