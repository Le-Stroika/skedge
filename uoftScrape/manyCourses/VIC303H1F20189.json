What pressure does trauma place on language, and agency, and how does it figure in commemoration, narrative, monumentalization, and other modes of representing the past? In this course an additional fee of up to $50 may be charged for activities outside of the classroom (e.g., field trips). Such fees will be confirmed in the course syllabus.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Victoria College", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "VIC309H1 as taken in 2011-2012, VIC310Y1", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2018 Fall", "breadths": [2], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["W Goetschel"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 57600, "duration": 7200, "location": "NF 235"}], "size": 25, "enrolment": 0}]}
