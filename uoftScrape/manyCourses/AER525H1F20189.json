{"id": "AER525H1F20189", "code": "AER525H1F", "name": "Robotics", "description": "The course addresses fundamentals of analytical robotics as well as design and control of industrial robots and their instrumentation. Topics include forward, inverse, and differential kinematics, screw representation, statics, inverse and forward dynamics, motion and force control of robot manipulators, actuation schemes, task-based and workspace design, mobile manipulation, and sensors and instrumentation in robotic systems. A series of experiments in the Robotics Laboratory will illustrate the course subjects.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Division of Engineering Science", "prerequisites": "AER301H1 and AER372H1", "exclusions": "ECE470H1", "level": 500, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2018 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["H Hakima"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 64800, "duration": 7200, "location": "HA 403"}, {"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "MY 315"}], "size": 60, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 43200, "duration": 10800, "location": "MC 120"}], "size": 15, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 43200, "duration": 10800, "location": "MC 120"}], "size": 15, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0103", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 64800, "end": 75600, "duration": 10800, "location": "MC 120"}], "size": 15, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0104", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 64800, "end": 75600, "duration": 10800, "location": "MC 120"}], "size": 15, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "MY 315"}], "size": 60, "enrolment": 0}]}
