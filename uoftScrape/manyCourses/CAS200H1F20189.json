It covers detailed recent (1980-present) case study material from South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia. It introduces students to the interdisciplinary study of political, sociocultural and economic interactions among these regions, as well as the transnational forces shaping internal dynamics throughout Asia. In addition, it examines the ways that forces stemming from Asia are affecting global processes, pushing scholarship to engage questions about the nature of democracy, authoritarianism, markets, social justice, and the meanings and media of cultural production. This course provides preparation for more advanced courses on Asia and globalization and provides the introductory gateway for the Contemporary Asian Studies major and minor. CAS200H1 introduces students to basic social science frameworks in the study of global Asia. This is a required course for the CAS major.
