{"id": "PHY450H1S20191", "code": "PHY450H1S", "name": "Relativistic Electrodynamics", "description": "The course illustrates, using classical electromagnetism, how symmetry principles and scaling arguments combine to determine the basic laws of physics. It is shown that the electromagnetic action (from which follow the equations of motion) is uniquely fixed by the principles of special relativity, gauge invariance, and locality. Additional topics include motion of relativistic particles in external electric and magnetic fields, radiation from point charges, and the breakdown of classical electromagnetism.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Physics", "prerequisites": "PHY350H1", "exclusions": "PHY353H1", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [5], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["P Savaria"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "MP 134"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "MP 134"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "MP 134"}], "size": 72, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "L2001", "instructors": ["P Savaria"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "MP 134"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "MP 134"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "MP 134"}], "size": 17, "enrolment": 0}]}
