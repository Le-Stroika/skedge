In this course an additional fee of up to $50 may be charged for activities outside of the classroom (e.g., field trips). Such fees will be confirmed in the course syllabus.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Victoria College", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 200, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [1], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["J Bemrose"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 57600, "duration": 7200, "location": "VC 304"}], "size": 25, "enrolment": 0}]}
