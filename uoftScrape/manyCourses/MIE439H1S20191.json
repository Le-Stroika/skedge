Topics include cellular mechanics, blood rheology, circulatory mechanics, respiratory mechanics, skeletal mechanics, and locomotion. Applications of these topics to biomimetic and biomechanical design are emphasized through a major, integrative group project.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Division of Engineering Science", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["J Usprech"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 50400, "duration": 7200, "location": "ES B142"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "ES B142"}], "size": 85, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 57600, "duration": 7200, "location": "MB 325"}, {"day": "MONDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 57600, "duration": 7200, "location": "MY 440"}], "size": 85, "enrolment": 0}]}
