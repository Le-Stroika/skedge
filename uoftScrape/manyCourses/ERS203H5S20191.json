{"id": "ERS203H5S20191", "code": "ERS203H5S", "name": "Rock Forming Processes", "description": "Many geological processes lead to the wide diversity of rocks found on and in the Earth. Melting of rocks at depth leads to volcanic activity and emplacement of magmas, forming igneous rocks. Weathering, erosion, and transport destroy mountains, carve the landscape we live in, and accumulate sedimentary rocks. Heat and pressure within the Earth metamorphose rocks as they are buried. This course focuses on how these processes can be understood by examination of rocks in the field, hand sample and thin section.
