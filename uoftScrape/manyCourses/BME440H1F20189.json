{"id": "BME440H1F20189", "code": "BME440H1F", "name": "Biomedical Engineering Technology and Investigation", "description": "An introduction to the principles of fundamental technologies used in biomedical engineering research including but not limited to tissue culture, protein assays or colourimetric enzymatic-based assays, spectroscopy, fluorescence microscopy, PCR, electrophoresis, DNA manipulation and transfection. Since these technologies enable the investigation of a wide range of research questions with importantclinical implications, the main focus of the course is learning these technologies while subsequent application within the lab will allow evidence-based investigation into specific research questions.Scientific literature (both good and bad) pertaining to each technology will be reviewed as examples of conducting investigations.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Institute of Biomaterials & Biomedical Engineering", "prerequisites": "CHE353H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2018 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 61200, "duration": 14400, "location": "MB 325"}, {"day": "MONDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 61200, "duration": 14400, "location": "MB 78"}], "size": 19, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 61200, "duration": 14400, "location": "MB 325"}, {"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 61200, "duration": 14400, "location": "MB 78"}], "size": 19, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["D Kilkenny Rocheleau"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 46800, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1210"}, {"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "RS 208"}], "size": 37, "enrolment": 0}]}
