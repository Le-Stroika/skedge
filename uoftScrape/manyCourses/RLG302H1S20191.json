{"id": "RLG302H1S20191", "code": "RLG302H1S", "name": "Dreams, Visions and the Invisible", "description": "In many cultures, dreaming is understood to open pathways to unseen realities and worlds populated by spirit beings, souls of the dead, noetic powers and avenues to mystical union. Dreams include visions, daydreams, and dissociative, altered states of consciousness. This course examines contributions from a variety of disciplines such as psychoanalytic psychology, anthropology, biblical criticism, neuroscience, and paleo-archaeology to the study of religious experiences. Topics include how human beings negotiate the contents of their minds that result in social and political agreements that distinguish what is deemed as real, thereby constituting acceptable religious experience. The course will also discuss crisis apparitions, alien abduction accounts, spirit possession and existence of life after death as culturally specific religious narratives that seek to articulate and organize dreams and other visionary experiences.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Department for the Study of Religion", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "RLG249H1", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [2], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["M Hewitt"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 46800, "duration": 7200, "location": "HI CART"}], "size": 60, "enrolment": 0}]}
