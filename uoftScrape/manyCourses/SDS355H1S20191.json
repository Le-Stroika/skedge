{"id": "SDS355H1S20191", "code": "SDS355H1S", "name": "Theories of Sexuality II: Contemporary Perspectives", "description": "This course is a short critical survey of some of the ways in which sexuality has been theorized over the past fifty years, paying particular attention to the fruitful relays between cultural theory and political activism at large. Its aim is not to be exhaustive but to highlight some of the more challenging approaches to the study of bodies, desires and the environments they\u2019re immersed in and with which the dynamically interact. We will examine how sexuality has been conceptualised, regulated and politically mobilized in recent years, specifically in North America.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Sexual Diversity Studies", "prerequisites": "SDS255H1/SDS256H1/UNI255H1/UNI256H1 or permission of the instructor", "exclusions": "UNI355H1", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [2], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["E Basile"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 50400, "duration": 7200, "location": "UC 144"}], "size": 59, "enrolment": 0}]}
