{"id": "ANT463H5F20189", "code": "ANT463H5F", "name": "Anthropologies of Water: On Meaning, Value, and Futures", "description": "Fresh water has become one of the world's most sought-after commodities and is said to soon replace oil in terms of its projected value. Scarce, increasingly polluted, and overused, water and the question of how we are to manage this precious resource has moved to center stage for politicians, financiers, bankers, development specialists, and activists all over the world. This class delves into the politics of water from an anthropological perspective through a set of readings that conceptualize water not only as resource but also as meaningful substance, symbol, and mediator of human and non-human relations. We ask how water is understood and managed - privately, as public good, as commons - and how these diverse ways of understanding and managing water have become intensely politicized. Class will consist mainly of discussions of ethnographic readings but also of hands-on class exercises and field trips. There will be at least one required field trip outside of class time (weekends and/or Reading Week) with additional travel costs that students will be required to pay through ancillary fees. See Anthropology department website for more details. In some years, students may additionally have the option of participating in an international learning experience during Reading Week that will have an additional cost and application process.
