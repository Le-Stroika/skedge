{"id": "ANT337H5F20189", "code": "ANT337H5F", "name": "Anthropology of Growth and Development", "description": "This course examines growth and development from a variety of theoretical perspectives. It begins with an examination of the fundamental biological principles of growth and how these are expressed throughout evolution. It explores the evolution of growth patterns among primates and hominins and compares patterns of growth among the living primates. The course examines human growth and development throughout infancy, childhood and adolescence and explores the influence of genetic, epigenetic and endocrine processes on the plasticity of human growth that ultimately produces the variability observed in our species. The goal of the course is to provide students with a complex understanding of how evolutionary and environmental processes interact in the production of growth and health in human populations.
