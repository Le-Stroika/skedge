The development of problem solving and design steps will be undertaken. This course will be taught with an emphasis on team development and problem solving as it relates to the practice of process safety management in engineering and engineering design. The teams will develop a PFD and P&ID\u2019s, as well as an operating procedure for a portion of the process. Thus, environmental and occupational health and safety becomes the vehicle through which the teamwork is performed.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "T0104", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 50400, "duration": 7200, "location": "WB 242"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 50400, "duration": 7200, "location": "MY 380"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 43200, "duration": 7200, "location": "MY 370"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0103", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 57600, "duration": 7200, "location": "WB 242"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["G Norval"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 57600, "duration": 3600, "location": "MS 2158"}], "size": 120, "enrolment": 0}]}
