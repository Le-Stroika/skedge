{"id": "MIE366H1F20189", "code": "MIE366H1F", "name": "Electronics for Robotics", "description": "The course provides an introduction to circuit analysis and design for mechatronics applications. The focus is on building a working knowledge of: (1) op-amp circuits, (2) step response, steady-state response, and frequency response, (3) passive and active filter design, and (4) applications of the above to mechatronics systems, including sensors and instrumentation. The course will continue with a study of the fundamental behaviour and specific applications of the major semiconductor devices, including (5) diodes and (6) field effect transistors. Additional \u2018design assignments\u2019 will require students to design real-world viable circuits for mechatronics applications, and laboratory experiments will present additional applications for all circuits being studied.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Division of Engineering Science", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2018 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["X Liu"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 36000, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1210"}, {"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 46800, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 1220"}], "size": 80, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 54000, "duration": 10800, "location": "MC 402"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 43200, "end": 54000, "duration": 10800, "location": "MC 402"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 2145"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 2145"}], "size": 50, "enrolment": 0}]}
