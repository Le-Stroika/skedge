Or how did it become the language we know today? This course presents a detailed study of the external and internal history of the Spanish language in which this evolution occurred. Special attention will be paid to the linguistic progress of the language from its Latin roots to Modern Spanish and to the socio-cultural, historical, political and literary influence that have affected its linguistic evolution. The main features of the Spanish language evolution will be put in practice through a close reading of representative Medieval, Renaissance and dialectal texts.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Spanish and Portuguese", "prerequisites": "SPA320Y1 or permission of instructor", "exclusions": "None", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [2], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["Y Iglesias"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 43200, "duration": 7200, "location": "VC 206"}], "size": 30, "enrolment": 0}]}
