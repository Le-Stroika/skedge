{"id": "APS440H1S20191", "code": "APS440H1S", "name": "Making Sense of Accidents", "description": "Despite the best of engineering practices, spectacular failures of complex technological systems occur regularly. Traditional engineering explanations for the causes of accidents utilize eventchain models and often blame operators. This course highlights the limitations of such models and shows that accidents in sociotechnical systems can be better understood using systems engineering. Further insights are provided by reviewing various sociological theories that have been advanced to explain and prevent accidents.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Cross Disciplinary Programs Office", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 72000, "end": 75600, "duration": 3600, "location": "RS 310"}], "size": 35, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["J Lebenhaft"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 68400, "end": 75600, "duration": 7200, "location": "AP 120"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 68400, "end": 72000, "duration": 3600, "location": "RS 310"}], "size": 35, "enrolment": 0}]}
