{"id": "CSB428H1F20189", "code": "CSB428H1F", "name": "Advanced Cell Biology II: Cell Polarity and Cytoskeletal Dynamics", "description": "This advanced course covers cell polarity and cytoskeletal dynamics emphasizing current literature. For each topic, the course examines (1) the proteins involved, (2) their interactions and regulation, and (3) how they organize specific cellular structures. The coordination of these complexes required for orchestrating complex cellular processes are addressed. These important topics of cell biology are pursued with question-driven lectures, and both round-table discussions and group presentations of research papers.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Cell and Systems Biology", "prerequisites": "Minimum grade of 73% in BCH311H1/CSB349H1/MGY311Y1, minimum grade of 73% in CSB328H1/CSB329H1/CSB331H1/CSB340H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2018 Fall", "breadths": [4], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["T Harris S Plotnikov"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 57600, "duration": 10800, "location": "AB 114"}], "size": 24, "enrolment": 0}]}
