Designed to increase opportunities to learn about education through a First Nation, M\u00e9tis and Inuit perspective, the course will increase knowledge and awareness about pedagogies, learning approaches and educational experiences related to indigenous people living in Canada. In line with indigenous ways of knowing, this course will be structured with learning that involves reflecting on personal actions by looking at ways that indigenous models of education support social and community well-being. Students taking the course will be encouraged to participate in a three-day field trip run in collaboration with the Centre of Student Engagement (Cat Criger) where they will have an opportunity to visit an indigenous First Nation community.
