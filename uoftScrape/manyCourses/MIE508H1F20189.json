{"id": "MIE508H1F20189", "code": "MIE508H1F", "name": "Fluids of Biological Systems", "description": "This course will teach students how to apply fundamental fluid mechanics to the study of biological systems. The course is divided into three modules, with the focus of the first two modules on the human circulatory and respiratory systems, respectively. Topics covered will include blood rheology, blood flow in the heart, arteries, veins and microcirculation, the mechanical properties of the heart as a pump; air flow in the lungs and airways, mass transfer across the walls of these systems, the fluid mechanics of the liquid-air interface of the alveoli, and artificial mechanical systems and devices for clinical aid. The third and final module will cover a range of other fluid problems in modern biology.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Mechanical & Industrial Engineering", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "", "level": 500, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2018 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["E Young"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1200"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1200"}, {"day": "MONDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1200"}], "size": 80, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 54000, "duration": 7200, "location": "MY 430"}], "size": 24, "enrolment": 0}]}
