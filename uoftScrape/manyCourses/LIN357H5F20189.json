This makes it the most widely spoken language in the world. Within this language exists a high degree of global dialect diversity. In this course, we will examine the structure and history of Englishes around world including British, North American, Antipodean, Caribbean, African, and Asian varieties. Students will also consider structural and sociolinguistic issues associated with English as a global language including creolization, post-creolization, the diffusion of innovation, language policy, and the linguistic effects of colonialism.", "division": "University of Toronto Mississauga", "department": "Language Studies", "prerequisites": "LIN101H5, LIN102H5, and LIN256/JAL253", "exclusions": "", "level": 300, "campus": "UTM", "term": "2018 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["D Denis"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 61200, "end": 68400, "duration": 7200, "location": "NE 3110"}], "size": 60, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 46800, "end": 50400, "duration": 3600, "location": "NE 3110"}], "size": 60, "enrolment": 0}]}
