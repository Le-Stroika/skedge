In turn, how organisms feed, breath, grow, and reproduce are integral to mitigating large-scale climate changes and organic cycles. Climate also works in tandem with large-scale geological processes to reshape the surface of our home. As such, these processes are intimately linked and ensures our planet remains habitable. After introducing how the Earth works, topics discussed will include how life on Earth has evolved, how ecosystems have changed in response to weather and climate change, and how large-scale geological processes affect climate and life [24L]", "division": "University of Toronto Mississauga", "department": "Chemical and Physical Sciences", "prerequisites": "", "exclusions": "ESS103H1, 102H1; EESA05H3, A06H3, B15H3", "level": 100, "campus": "UTM", "term": "2018 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["P Ashwell"], "times": [{"day": "TUESDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "DV 2074"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 39600, "end": 43200, "duration": 3600, "location": "DV 2074"}], "size": 270, "enrolment": 0}]}
