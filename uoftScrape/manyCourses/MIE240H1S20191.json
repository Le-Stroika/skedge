Consideration of impacts of human physical, physiological, perceptual, and cognitive factors on the design and use of engineered systems. Basic concepts of anthropometrics, work-related hazards, shiftwork, workload, human error and reliability, and human factors standards. The human-centred systems design process, including task analysis, user requirements generation, prototyping, and usability evaluation. Design of work/rest schedules, procedures, displays and controls, and training systems; design for error prevention and human-computer interaction; design for aging populations.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Mechanical & Industrial Engineering", "prerequisites": "MIE242H1 recommended", "exclusions": "", "level": 200, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2019 Winter", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["B Donmez"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 57600, "duration": 3600, "location": "HS 610"}, {"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 54000, "end": 61200, "duration": 7200, "location": "MC 252"}], "size": 133, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 2135"}], "size": 45, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0102", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA B024"}], "size": 45, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0103", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 1240"}], "size": 40, "enrolment": 0}]}
