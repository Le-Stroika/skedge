{"id": "CIV416H1F20189", "code": "CIV416H1F", "name": "Reinforced Concrete II", "description": "This course covers the behaviour and ultimate strength of reinforced concrete structures. Members subjected to flexure, axial load, shear and torsion are treated. Detailing of reinforcement, the design of floor systems and the design of shear walls are covered. An introduction to the seismic design of reinforced concrete structures is made. Emphasis is given to the relationship between recent research results and current building codes. A brief treatment of the behaviour and design of masonry walls is included.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Civil and Mineral Engineering", "prerequisites": "CIV313H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 400, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2018 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["Z Kharal"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 36000, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 2175"}, {"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 32400, "end": 39600, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 1240"}], "size": 45, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "T0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 43200, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 2175"}], "size": 45, "enrolment": 0}]}
