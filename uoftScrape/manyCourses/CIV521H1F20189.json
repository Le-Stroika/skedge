The lectures are complemented with laboratory experiments. Theoretical topics include: stress and strain, linear elasticity, failure modes and models of rocks, fracture of rocks, inelastic behavior of rock, seismic waves in rocks.Experiments include: preparation of rock samples, uniaxial compressive strength measurements, Brazilian disc tests for rock tensile strength, fracture toughness measurements with core-based rock samples.", "division": "Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering", "department": "Civil and Mineral Engineering", "prerequisites": "CME210H1", "exclusions": "", "level": 500, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2018 Fall", "breadths": [], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["K Xia"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 43200, "duration": 7200, "location": "BA 2139"}, {"day": "MONDAY", "start": 61200, "end": 64800, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA B026"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "P0101", "instructors": [], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 57600, "end": 61200, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 3008"}], "size": 20, "enrolment": 0}]}
