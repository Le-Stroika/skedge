Brief introduction to NP-completeness: polynomial time reductions, examples of various NP-complete problems, self-reducibility. Additional topics may include approximation and randomized algorithms. Students will be expected to show good design principles and adequate skills at reasoning about the correctness and complexity of algorithms.", "division": "Faculty of Arts and Science", "department": "Computer Science", "prerequisites": "CSC263H1/CSC265H1", "exclusions": "CSC375H1", "level": 300, "campus": "UTSG", "term": "2018 Fall", "breadths": [5], "meeting_sections": [{"code": "L0101", "instructors": ["A Borodin M Brudno"], "times": [{"day": "MONDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 39600, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1170"}, {"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 39600, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1170"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 50400, "end": 54000, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1170"}, {"day": "FRIDAY", "start": 36000, "end": 39600, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1170"}], "size": 125, "enrolment": 0}, {"code": "L5101", "instructors": ["A Borodin M Brudno"], "times": [{"day": "WEDNESDAY", "start": 64800, "end": 75600, "duration": 10800, "location": "BA 1180"}, {"day": "THURSDAY", "start": 61200, "end": 64800, "duration": 3600, "location": "BA 1180"}], "size": 125, "enrolment": 0}]}
